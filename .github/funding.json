Implemented using the IHP SG13G2 open PDK and a fully open-source EDA flow, enabling end-to-end, silicon-backed RFIC development without proprietary tools. Only a few foundries worldwide have opened their PDKs; IHP (Germany) is one of them, providing an affordable fabrication path built around an open-source EDA and PDK ecosystem.",
